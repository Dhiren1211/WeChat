Step by step switching/ Strowger switching:
.Uni-Selector:
 -The rotary motion of this switch is in one direction 
  so it can moves only in a single direction.
.Two motion Selector:
 - The rotary motion of this switch can moves in two direction
   Vertical as well as Horizontal 
 - It has 10 levels and each level have 10 contacts thus total of 100 contacts are assemble.

>>Multi Meter is a meter with multi function which can measure current, voltage, and resistance.

>>Telecommunication helps in development of nation in various factor
  - Good governance
  - Business Sector
  - Peson communication 

>> Cross-bar Switching: It is a switching system where the cross points are arranged in a matric form and cross point are connected with two bars one horizontal and another is vertical and electromagnet helps in switching.

>>Pliers are the mechanical tools which are used to gripping the items.

>>Sky wave is the radio communication technology where radio frequency of 3MHz to 30MHz

>> In the block diagram of telecommunication there are several components:
 . Information source
 . input transducer 
 . transmitter 
 . channel 
 . noise 
 . receiver
 . output transducer 
 . destination
 . Original information
>> Mechanical tools: Mechanical tools are the tools whic are used in telecommunication for make task essier and faster by the telecommunication technician
